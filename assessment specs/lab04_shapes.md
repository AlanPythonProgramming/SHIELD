### Tasks

#### Implementation
1. Open `src/shapes.ts`.
2. Fix all linting errors in the pre-written `drawShape` function.
   - Ensure compliance with the provided linting rules.

3. Ensure the following commands run without any errors:
   ```shell
   $ npm run lint
   $ npm test
   ```

#### Testing
- Tests for `drawShape` are provided in `src/shapes.test.js`.

#### Linting
- Use the `lint-fix` script to automatically fix any auto-fixable linting errors:
  ```shell
  $ npm run lint-fix
  ```

### Continuous Integration

1. Open `.gitlab-ci.yml`.
2. Update the pipeline to include:
   - `npm install`
   - `npm test`
   - `npm run lint`

### Submission

1. Use `git` to `add`, `commit`, and `push` your changes to your master branch.
2. Verify your code is uploaded to the GitLab repository.
3. No further action is required after pushing to the master branch; submissions will be auto-collected.

### Notes

1. Ensure your code adheres strictly to the linting rules defined in `.eslintrc.json`.
2. Refactoring the code to improve readability is encouraged but not mandatory.
3. Passing the tests and linting checks ensures full marks for this lab.
